The sections in this repository are taught by Mr. Sameer Saini in his Udemy course "Build ASP.NET Core Web API - Scratch To Finish (.NET8 API)". A beginner-level knowledge of ASP.NET Core is sufficient enough to understand the concepts content in this repository. The end product is a simple region-based web API application. The controller itself handles the business logic without a clear separation of concern. It should be a topic of minimum discussion because of how the application is structured. Concepts such as DTOs, asynchronous programming, repository design pattern, model validation, filtering, sorting & pagination, authentication & authorization with JWT, logging with Serilog, API versioning, and deploying to Azure (no, not in this repository, but deploying to Azure is covered by the instructor) are clearly illustrated along with shedding some light on libraries such as Automapper, and FluentValidation.
